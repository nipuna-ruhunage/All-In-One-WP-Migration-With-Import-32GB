# All-In-One-WP-Migration-With-Import-32GB

(from Version 6.77)
This is the last version of the All In One WP Migration plugin to include the import function. Versions after this (6.78+) require you to download an additional plugin, not hosted in the Wordpress plugin repository, which is a very large security risk.

The file upload size limit has been modified to be 32GB. To change this you may define the limit in byes on line 284 in constants.php.

// =================
// = Max File Size =
// =================
define( 'AI1WM_MAX_FILE_SIZE', 34359738368 );
